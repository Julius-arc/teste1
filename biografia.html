            <p>
                When people eat out, they often go to fast food restaurants.
                There people order their food at the counter and have to
                wait only a few seconds or minutes.
                Then they carry their food to a table, sit down, eat it, and throw their trash away.
                Sometimes people leave their trash on the table for the employees to clean up.
                It doesn’t take too long to eat a meal at
                a fast food restaurant, but it’s not always a healthy choice.
